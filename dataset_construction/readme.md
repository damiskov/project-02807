# Dataset Construction

This folder contains all the code required to generate the dataset for the project. The process can be separated into two pipelines:
1. midi -> sequence -> metadata + sequence
    - Used for our baseline/traditional methods.
2. midi -> wav -> embeddings + metadata
    - Stores embeddings generated by the 3 models.
    - Used for our more advanced techniques.

You will find two files:
1. `midi_to_wav.py`
    - A cli-based script that recursively walks through the midi folder and generates the .wav files.
    - It is necessary to have `FluidSynth` installed for this as well as the `FluidR3_GM` soundfont.
2. `dataset_builder.py`
    - A class that encapsulates all the logic for the two aforementioned pipelines.
